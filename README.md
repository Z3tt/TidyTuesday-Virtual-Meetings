This is the repository for the Virtual Meetings related to the [#TidyTuesday challenge](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), a weekly social data project that focusses on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with `{ggplot2}`, `{tidyr}`, `{dplyr}` and other tools that are part of the [`{tidyverse}`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) ecosystem. The project was founded in 2018 by [Thomas Mock](https://thomasmock.netlify.com/) and organized by the [R4DS ("`R` for Data Science") online learning community](https://twitter.com/r4dscommunity). The intent of the challenge is to provide a safe and supportive forum to practice their wrangling and data visualization skills.  

And the intent of the virtual meetings is to connect and to get to know each other, exchange feedback and ideas and exciting news! All organizational stuff such as dates, topics and the current survey is discussed in our [Slack workspace](https://www.rfordatasci.com/).

## [Surveys](https://github.com/Z3tt/TidyTuesday-Virtual-Meetings/tree/master/surveys/)

Each meeting, we ask a question to the group and one of us is chosen to visualize the results. This way, we do not only get to know our community better but also collect visualizations showcasing the variety of designs in  our community.

### First Meeting: "What is your favorite geom?"

## [Logo](https://github.com/Z3tt/TidyTuesday-Virtual-Meetings/tree/master/logo/)

The hex logo was made in R with the help of the [`hexSticker` package](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker). The code can be found [here](https://github.com/Z3tt/TidyTuesday-Virtual-Meetings/blob/master/logo/hexlogo_virtual_meetings.R).
